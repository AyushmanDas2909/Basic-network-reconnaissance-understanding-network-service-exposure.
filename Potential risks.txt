----- Highest Priority Risks (Windows File Sharing) -----
The open ports on 192.168.29.88 are the most critical to examine:

Ports 135 (msrpc), 139 (netbios), and 445 (SMB):

Risk: These ports are the backbone of Windows networking and file sharing. When exposed, they are extremely common targets for network worms (like WannaCry and EternalBlue), credential harvesting, and lateral movement attacks.

Mitigation: These ports must be blocked from the public internet and, ideally, should be restricted even internally (via a local firewall) to only the devices that absolutely need file-sharing access.

Port 902 (vmauthd/VMware):

Risk: This is a control port for virtualization software. If an attacker gains access, they could potentially compromise the entire virtual machine environment or gain remote console access.

Mitigation: Ensure the service behind it is up-to-date, protected by a strong password, and access is limited only to authorized hosts.

----- Moderate Priority Risks (Discovery & Management) -----
These ports are not inherently dangerous but increase the network's "attack surface" by revealing configuration details and offering entry points.

Port 1900 (upnp) & Port 2869 (icslap/UPnP):

Risk: UPnP protocols allow devices to automatically open ports on the router (automatic port forwarding). A compromise of one device can allow an attacker to bypass the router's firewall entirely.

Mitigation: Disable UPnP on the router and any local devices that do not strictly require it.

Ports 7073, 8082, 8200, 8443 (Alternate Web/App Ports):

Risk: These are non-standard ports, likely running a web service, application, or proxy. The main risk is an unpatched vulnerability in the specific application running on the port, or a weak administrative password for a management interface.

Mitigation: Determine the exact software running on each port (you can use Nmap scripts for this) and ensure it is fully patched and secured with strong credentials.
